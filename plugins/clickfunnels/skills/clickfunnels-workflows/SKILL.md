# ClickFunnels Workflows Skill

A discovery hub for the automation **Workflows** API - standalone automations made of
**triggers** (events that enroll a contact) and ordered **steps** (the actions that run),
with conditional / A-B branching, plus **runs** (a contact's pass through the workflow).

## When to use this skill

- Stand up an automation: enroll on an event, then send an email, tag the contact, set a
  custom attribute, create a sales opportunity, grant course/community access, fire a
  webhook, wait, or hand off to another workflow.
- Route contacts down a **conditional split** (matches a stored filter -> matched/unmatched) or
  an **A-B split test** (weighted variants).
- Enable a workflow so it runs live, or **manually enroll** a specific contact.
- Read back the whole automation tree (`/structure`) or inspect a contact's runs.

## Authentication

OAuth2 password grant using an OAuth application's credentials - the same access
token used across the V2 API. See the
[Refine Filters Skill](https://accounts.myclickfunnels.com/.well-known/refine-filters/skill.md#authentication) for details.
Any token authorized for the workspace can read and write.

## Lifecycle (read this first)

A workflow is built in steps and only goes live when you explicitly enable it:

1. **Create** -> always starts as a **draft** (`status: "draft"`, `disabled: true`). You
   **cannot** create an already-enabled workflow, and `disabled` is not settable on create or
   update.
2. **Add >=1 trigger** (and usually some steps).
3. **Enable** (`POST .../enable`) -> flips to `status: "live"`. Enable **requires at least one
   active trigger** (422 otherwise) - which is why enabling can't happen at create time.
4. Live workflows enroll contacts when a trigger fires; you can also **manually enroll**.

## Creating a workflow

```http
POST /api/v2/workspaces/:workspace_id/workflows
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "workflow": { "name": "Welcome Series" } }
```

`run_type` is server-controlled - API-created workflows are always `asynchronous` (steps run
via background jobs), so you don't pass it. The response includes `public_id`,
`status: "draft"`, `disabled: true`, and `active_runs_count` / `completed_runs_count`.

## Triggers

A trigger declares the `event_type_key` that enrolls a contact, plus optional **condition
FK ids** that narrow when it fires. Created triggers default to `active: true`.

```http
POST /api/v2/workflows/:workflow_id/triggers
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "workflows_trigger": { "event_type_key": "$contact.tag_applied", "contacts_tag_id": "<tag_public_id>" } }
```

**Valid `event_type_key` values** (anything else -> 422):

- Contacts: `$contact.tag_applied`, `$contact.tag_removed`
- Site: `$optin`, `$view`
- Orders / billing: `$order.successful_purchase`, `$order.cancelled`, `$order.churned`,
  `$transaction.renewal_failed`, `$subscription.upgraded`, `$subscription.downgraded`
- Sales: `$sales.contact_entered_stage`, `$sales.contact_exited_stage`
- Courses: `$course.enroll`, `$course.unenroll`, `$course.complete`,
  `$course.lesson_complete`, `$course.lesson_view`, `$course.section_complete`
- Community: `$community.join`, `$community.group_join`, `$community.topic_join`,
  `$community.post`, `$community.post_view`, `$community.ban`, `$community.unban`
- Email engagement: `$email.sent`, `$email.open`, `$email.click`, `$email.bounce`,
  `$email.spam_complaint`; and per-step `$send_email_step.sent`/`.open`/`.click`/`.bounce`/`.spam_complaint`
- Messaging: `$message_hub_event.contact_conversation_started`, `...contact_responded`,
  `...agent_conversation_started`, `...agent_responded`
- Appointments / survey: `$appointments.appointment_scheduled`,
  `$calendar_event.contact_registered`, `$survey.complete`

**Condition FKs** (all public ids, workspace-scoped + type-checked): `contacts_tag_id`,
`funnel_id`, `page_id`, `product_id`, `product_variant_id`, `sales_pipelines_id`,
`current_sales_pipelines_stage_id`, `course_id`, `courses_lesson_id`, `courses_section_id`,
`community_id`, `communities_space_id`, `communities_space_group_id`,
`appointments_calendar_id`, `appointments_event_type_id`, `emails_broadcasts_id`,
`calendar_event_id`, `survey_workflow_id`. Booleans: `active`, `allow_anonymous_contacts`.

> ! For **site events** (`$optin`, `$view`) scope with **`page_id`**, not `funnel_id` - these
> events carry no funnel association, so a `funnel_id` condition silently never matches.

## Steps

A step's body is `step_type_settings`: a **single-key map whose key both selects the step
type and types its value** (the key equals the read-only `step_type`).

```http
POST /api/v2/workflows/:workflow_id/steps
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "workflows_step": {
    "step_type_settings": { "contact_tag_step": { "action": "Add Tags", "contacts_tag_ids": ["<tag_public_id>"] } }
} }
```

Creating a `send_email_step` also requires a complete business mailing address in
the workspace's email settings; otherwise the request returns `422` and creates no
step. Check it with `GET /api/v2/workspaces/:workspace_id/emails/settings` and set it
with `PUT` to the same path. The [Emails skill](https://accounts.myclickfunnels.com/.well-known/emails/skill.md#business-mailing-address-prerequisite)
has the request body.

**Send-email template ownership**: if step creation sends `template_id` A, ClickFunnels
copies it and the response's `step_type_settings.send_email_step.template_id` is clone B.
Later edits to A do not affect the step. `template_id` is create-only - including it in a
step `PATCH` returns `422`; update the step's email with `html_body`/`text_body`, or create
a new step to use another template.

**Placement** (optional): omit -> append to the end of the trunk; `position: <n>` -> insert at a
0-based trunk index; `after_step_id: <step_public_id>` -> insert right after that step. For a
branch, use `parent_step_id: <split_public_id>` + `branch`.

**Repositioning an existing step**: the same placement fields (`position`, `after_step_id`,
`parent_step_id` + `branch`) are also accepted on `PATCH /api/v2/workflows/steps/:id` - send
them (with or without `step_type_settings`) to move a step within the trunk or into/out of a
branch. `sort_order` is recomputed for you. Example - move a step to just after another:

```http
PATCH /api/v2/workflows/steps/:id
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "workflows_step": { "after_step_id": "<other_step_public_id>" } }
```

### Step catalog

| `step_type` key | What it does | Key settings (enums / notes) |
|---|---|---|
| `send_email_step` | Send a marketing email | `template_id`, or an inline `html_body`/`text_body` that mints a template (`template_id` wins when both are given - see the [Emails skill](https://accounts.myclickfunnels.com/.well-known/emails/skill.md)); plus `subject`, `preheadline`, `from_address_id`, `reply_to_address_id`. A subject-only step is accepted but `notSetup` and won't send. |
| `send_asset_step` | Email a downloadable asset | `asset_id` |
| `send_chat_message_step` | Send a chat message | `inbox_key`, `message`, `subject`, `start_new_conversation` |
| `contact_tag_step` | Add/remove tags | `action` in `"Add Tags"`/`"Remove Tags"`, `contacts_tag_ids` (array) |
| `contact_custom_attribute_step` | Set/clear a custom attribute | `action` in `"Add Attribute"`/`"Remove Attribute"`, `value`, `field_id` |
| `delay_step` | Wait before continuing | `delay_type` in `relative`/`day_of_week`/`day_of_month`; `interval` in `minutes`/`hours`/`days`/`weeks`/`months`/`years`; `duration`; `time_zone` (a time zone name such as `Eastern Time (US & Canada)`; a TZ database id like `America/New_York` is accepted and stored as the name with the same clock; anything else is a 422; names are listed in the [Time Zones guide](https://developers.myclickfunnels.com/docs/timezones)) or `use_contact_time_zone`; window fields |
| `notify_step` | Notify team members | `message`, `notify_type` within `["Email","Notification"]`, `user_ids` (array). **`user_ids` must be team members** - discover them via `GET /api/v2/teams/{team_id}/memberships` (use each membership's `user_id`); an id that is not a member of this workspace's team is rejected `422`. |
| `deliver_webhook_step` | POST to an outgoing webhook endpoint | `webhooks_outgoing_endpoint_id` |
| `enroll_step` | Enroll in course(s) | `course_ids`, `section_ids` (arrays). **Enrollment runs off `section_ids`** - pass the section ids you want to enroll in (find them via `GET /api/v2/courses/{course_id}/sections`). `course_ids` alone is accepted and the step shows `active`, but enrolls no one at run time. |
| `unenroll_contact_step` | Unenroll from course(s) | `course_ids`, `section_ids` (arrays); unenroll honors both. |
| `grant_community_access_step` | Grant community space access | `space_ids` (array) |
| `revoke_community_access_step` | Revoke community space access | `space_ids` (array) |
| `create_opportunity_step` | Create a sales opportunity | `name`, `value`, `assignment_strategy` in `unassigned`/`membership`/`pipeline`/`round_robin`, `move_existing`, `sales_pipeline_id`, `sales_pipelines_stage_id`, `membership_id`, `membership_ids` |
| `move_step` | Hand the contact to another workflow | `workflow_id` (cannot be its own workflow or an archived one -> 422) |
| `conditional_split_step` | Branch on a stored filter | `condition.filter_id` (a Refine filter public id) |
| `split_test_step` | Weighted A-B branch | `variants`: exactly 2 `{ "weight": n }`, integers summing to 100 (default 50/50) |

Each step response carries a `state`: `active` (set up and will run), `notSetup` (accepted but
non-functional - fix the settings), or `notDefined` (a placeholder). **Always check `state`** -
a `notSetup` step is silently skipped at run time.

## Step stats

Where contacts stand in relation to a step, and - for a send-email step - how the email it
sends actually performed: opens, clicks, bounces, unsubscribes, spam complaints, and
attributed revenue. These are the numbers the workflow builder shows under each step. They
are NOT on the step record; they come from a separate endpoint that answers for every
`step_type`:

```http
GET /api/v2/workflows/steps/{step_id}/stats
```

Every step returns `contacts`. `are_here` is the number of contacts sitting at the step right
now (runs whose current step is this one) and is the one figure that ignores the timerange.
`were_here` counts contacts who left the step inside the window, once per pass through it.

Only a `send_email_step` returns `email`; for every other `step_type` it is `null`, so a delay
or tag step never reads as an email that performed badly. Check `email` for `null` before
reading into it.

A workflow step is not a broadcast: it has no audience and no send window, because it keeps
sending for as long as the workflow runs and contacts keep reaching it. So there is nothing
to report as queued or in progress, and you always choose a window. It defaults to the last
30 days and takes `timerange_start` / `timerange_end`, clamped to a 90-day maximum. **Read
`timerange` back from the response** - it reports the window actually used, after clamping.
A step whose email last sent months ago reports zero `sends` on the default window; widen it
rather than reading that as no engagement.

```json
{
  "step": { "id": 42, "public_id": "RBxAQx", "name": "Welcome email", "step_type": "send_email_step" },
  "workflow": { "id": 7, "public_id": "zmXVGz", "name": "New lead nurture" },
  "currency": "USD",
  "timerange": { "from": "2026-08-05T00:00:00Z", "to": "2026-09-04T00:00:00Z" },
  "contacts": { "are_here": 12, "were_here": 1240 },
  "email": {
    "performance": {
      "sends": 1240, "recipients": 1180, "failed": 4, "bounced": 21,
      "opened": 890, "unique_opens": 604, "clicked": 173, "unique_clicks": 148,
      "unsubscribed": 9, "spam_complaints": 2,
      "open_rate": 51, "click_rate": 13, "click_to_open_rate": 25,
      "bounce_rate": 2, "unsubscribe_rate": 1
    },
    "revenue": {
      "total": "3480.00", "orders_count": 24,
      "per_recipient": "2.95", "per_unique_open": "5.76", "per_unique_click": "23.51"
    }
  }
}
```

A `delay_step` answers the same envelope with `"contacts": { "are_here": 57, "were_here": 1183 }`
and `"email": null`.

`sends` counts a contact once per pass through the step, so a workflow that loops makes it
larger than `recipients` (distinct contacts sent to). `open_rate`, `click_rate`,
`bounce_rate` and `unsubscribe_rate` are shares of `recipients`, not of `sends`;
`click_to_open_rate` is unique clicks over unique opens. Rates are whole percentages and
round to the nearest integer, so a share under 0.5% reads `0` next to a non-zero count - the
counts are authoritative. The workflow builder's percentages under a step divide by `sends`
rather than `recipients`, so when a step sent to a contact more than once the app shows a
lower rate than this endpoint for the same window. The counts match; only the denominator
differs.

**Rates are not shares of one fixed group of contacts.** Sends and opens are each counted
inside the window on their own, so a contact who was sent the email before the window and
opens it inside the window lands in `unique_opens` but not in `recipients`. A window with
few new sends and many opens of older emails can therefore show an `open_rate` above 100,
and any rate is `0` when its denominator is `0`, however many opens there were. When a rate
looks odd, widen the window to cover the sends you care about, and trust the counts.

Revenue is attributed when the buyer's **last tracked source within 30 days** was a click on
one of the email's links, so a later touch from elsewhere supersedes it. Each attributed
order contributes its **first** paid invoice, and only when that invoice was issued inside
the window: renewals never count, and an order whose first payment predates the window
contributes nothing even if a renewal was paid inside it. Only live-mode orders paid in the
workspace currency count. The engagement counts, in contrast, do include test-mode sends -
so treat the revenue-per-X figures as live money over possibly-mixed counts.

The broadcast equivalent is `GET /api/v2/emails/broadcasts/{broadcast_id}/stats` (see the
[Emails skill](https://accounts.myclickfunnels.com/.well-known/emails/skill.md)). Its `performance` and `revenue` blocks sit at
the top level rather than under `email`, and it reports `delivered` in place of `sends` /
`recipients` / `failed`; the engagement and revenue keys are otherwise the same. A broadcast
is sent once, so it reports on its own send window and takes no timerange parameters.

## Branching

Both split types auto-create their two branch containers plus a convergence node (where the
branches rejoin); you never manage convergence by hand. Add steps into a branch with
`parent_step_id` + `branch`:

- **conditional_split_step** - `branch`: `"matched"` or `"unmatched"` (the legacy `match`/`fallback` aliases are still accepted).
- **split_test_step** - `branch`: `"0"` or `"1"` (variant index).

```http
POST /api/v2/workflows/:workflow_id/steps
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "workflows_step": {
    "parent_step_id": "<conditional_split_public_id>",
    "branch": "matched",
    "step_type_settings": { "contact_tag_step": { "action": "Add Tags", "contacts_tag_ids": ["<tag_public_id>"] } }
} }
```

A step added with no placement after a split lands **after** that split's convergence (i.e. on
the main trunk again). The `filter_id` for a conditional split is the public id of a stored
Refine filter in this workspace (see the
[Refine Filters Skill](https://accounts.myclickfunnels.com/.well-known/refine-filters/skill.md)); raw numeric ids are rejected.

## Enabling, disabling

```http
POST /api/v2/workflows/:id/enable      # requires >=1 active trigger -> status: "live"
POST /api/v2/workflows/:id/disable     # -> status: "draft", disabled: true
```

## Runs - manual enrollment

```http
POST /api/v2/workflows/:workflow_id/runs
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "run": { "contact_id": "<contact_public_id>", "skip_communication": false } }
```

Enrolls the contact and executes the steps (the workflow must be enabled). Set
`skip_communication: true` to suppress email/chat sends while still applying tags/attributes,
etc. List with filters and inspect a run:

```http
GET /api/v2/workflows/:workflow_id/runs?filter[contact_id]=<pid>&filter[status]=completed
GET /api/v2/workflows/runs/:id
```

Run `status` is derived: `active`, `paused`, `completed`, or `canceled`. Event-driven runs
carry a non-null `event_id`; manual enrollments do not.

## Reading the structure

```http
GET /api/v2/workflows/:id/structure
```

Returns the workflow header, its `triggers[]`, and the ordered `steps[]` with each step's
`step_type` + `step_type_settings`. Splits expose their `branches` (`matched`/`unmatched`) or
`variants` (`weight`) inline with nested `steps`, plus a `convergence_step_id` - the id of the
step the branches rejoin at (the first step after the split; `null` if nothing follows it). In
the example below the `VIP Check` split's branches both continue to the `Offer A/B` split test,
so its `convergence_step_id` is that step's id (`1172`); the trailing split test has none
(`null`). Internal container/convergence nodes are spliced out, so it's a clean tree you can
walk directly. This is the best single view to verify what you built.

FK references (`workflow_id`, `*_id` inside `step_type_settings`, `convergence_step_id`) are raw
integers; each node also carries its own integer `id` + obfuscated `public_id`.
