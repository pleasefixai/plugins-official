description: Diagnose why a Linq line's reputation is AT_RISK, CRITICAL, or flagged, and find the code responsible. Runs a reputation audit through Linq's server, maps each driver to the integration checks it implicates, and proposes fixes. Use when someone asks to audit or fix line reputation, why a line got flagged, or why messages stopped being delivered.

# Diagnose and fix line reputation

Starts from what a line's reputation actually is, not from a generic sweep. The
audit says which drivers are dragging the line down; this skill turns those into
the specific code that caused them.

Requires Linq's server, which this plugin does not carry. If its tools are not
available, say so: the user can add it as a custom server in Settings with the
command `npx -y @linqapp/sdk-mcp@latest` (it reads the credential `linq login`
saves). Until then, run the full audit of the `linq:linq-best-practices` skill
instead — it needs no credentials and sweeps everything, just without knowing
which findings actually matter for this line.

## What this skill will and will not do

**It proposes changes. It never applies them.** Report findings and show diffs;
let the developer apply them. This holds for every finding, not just the
compliance ones.

**A code fix does not repair a reputation.** Reputation recovers from subsequent
sending behavior. Fixing the loop that spiked a line stops the cause; the line
recovers as it sends cleanly from then on. Never tell someone their reputation is
fixed — say what was causing it and what changes now. For a `flagged` line, the
honest answer is to move active traffic off it and let it recover.

## Step 1 — Triage the pool

One cheap call, no audit needed:

```
GET /v3/phone_numbers   →   client.phoneNumbers.list()
```

Each line carries `reputation.status` (`HEALTHY` / `AT_RISK` / `CRITICAL` /
`OPTED_OUT`) and a `doc_url`.

- If the user named a line, audit that one.
- If they did not, show the unhealthy lines ranked worst-first and ask which to
  audit. Do not audit the whole pool unprompted — each audit is a separate job.

## Step 2 — Run the audit

```
POST /v3/phone_numbers/{phoneNumber}/reputation_audit        → { audit_id, status }
GET  /v3/phone_numbers/{phoneNumber}/reputation_audit/{id}   → { status, report }
```

Poll the GET until `status` is `complete` or `error`.

Handle these, they are normal:

- **`409`** — an audit is already running for this line. Poll the existing one
  rather than starting another.
- **`429`** — cooldown since the last audit. `Retry-After` carries the wait. Tell
  the user when they can re-run; do not spin.
- **`404` on the audit endpoints, or no such SDK method** — this API may not be
  available on the caller's SDK version. Fall back: report `reputation.status`
  from Step 1, note that driver-level diagnosis is unavailable, and run the full
  `linq-best-practices` checklist instead of a targeted one. Say that is what you
  are doing.

Each `execute` call is capped near 5 minutes total with 30 seconds per request. If
the audit has not completed by then, return the `audit_id`, tell the user, and
fetch the result in a follow-up call rather than burning the sandbox on a poll loop.

## Step 3 — Route drivers to checks

The report's `drivers[]` each carry a `key`, a one-sentence `summary`, and often a
`metric`. `evidence.unhealthy_chats[]` carries the specific `chat_id`s behind
them, each with its own `driver_keys` — those are the conversations to cite.

Load the `linq-best-practices` skill and audit **only** the sections a driver
implicates:

| Driver | Section to audit | Look for |
|---|---|---|
| `volume_spike` | Volume & ramp | Scheduled or triggered sends that take a quiet line to a large day in one step |
| `new_conversation_rate` | Volume & ramp | Bulk import, list upload, campaign kickoff — anything opening a whole audience at once |
| `opt_out_handling` | Opt-out (all of it) | Keyword scan on `message.received`, `403`/`2024` handling, `override_optout` in a retry loop |
| `flagged` | Sending & line selection | A hardcoded `from`, or `available_number` called per send — both defeat failover off a flagged line |
| `low_engagement` | Engagement & cadence | **Report only.** Content and targeting, not code |
| `overall_conversation_health` | rollup of the above | **Report only.** Audit whatever other drivers appear alongside it |
| `other` | — | Report the `summary` verbatim; do not invent a code cause |

Auditing sections no driver implicates is noise. If the user wants the full sweep,
that is what the full audit of `linq:linq-best-practices` is for.

## Step 4 — Find the code

Locate the integration the same way the full audit of `linq:linq-best-practices` does: search for the Linq base
URL (`api.linqapp.com/api/partner`), `/v3/` request paths, an official SDK
(`@linqapp/sdk`, `linq-python`, `github.com/linq-team/linq-go`), and the inbound
webhook handler.

Ground every finding in code you actually read, and cite `file:line`. If a driver
fires but the responsible code is not in this repository — sending happens in
another service, a scheduler you cannot see — say exactly that. Do not attribute a
driver to unrelated code because it was the closest match.

## Step 5 — Report

1. **What the line's reputation is** — status, and each driver with its `summary`
   and `metric`.
2. **What the code does** — table of Driver | Check | Status (pass / gap / unknown)
   | Where (`file:line`).
3. **Proposed changes** — a diff per gap, with the driver it addresses. Say plainly
   that you have not applied them.
4. **Not a code problem** — for `low_engagement`, `overall_conversation_health`, or
   `flagged`, name the cause and pass through the driver's own guidance, which
   already reads as advice. For `flagged`, lead with moving traffic off the line.
5. **What happens next** — which changes stop which driver from recurring, and that
   recovery follows sending behavior over time.

Cite `evidence.unhealthy_chats[].chat_id` where it supports a finding — those are
the partner's own conversations, verifiable against their send logs with
`GET /v3/chats/{chatId}`.

If every implicated check passes, say so. A clean integration with a bad
reputation is a real outcome, and inventing a code change to look productive
wastes the developer's time and buries the actual cause.
