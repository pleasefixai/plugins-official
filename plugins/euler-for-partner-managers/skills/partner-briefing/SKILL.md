name: partner-briefing
description: Generate a pre-meeting briefing about a specific partner — 30-second read with what they'll want to discuss, what you should bring up, and key stats from the last 30 days. Use this skill whenever the user mentions a partner call, partner meeting, pre-call prep, partner briefing, or asks "what should I know before I talk to a partner", "prep me for my call with this partner", or "give me a quick read on a partner" — even when the word "briefing" isn't used.

# Partner Briefing — Pre-meeting prep for a partner call

## When to use this skill

Invoke whenever the user types something like:

- "Briefing on <partner>"
- "Prep me for my call with <partner>"
- "What should I know before I meet <partner>?"
- "Give me a quick read on <partner>"
- "I have a call with <partner> in 30 minutes"
- `/euler-for-partner-managers:partner-briefing`

DO NOT invoke for:

- **Quarterly retrospectives** — use `generate-qbr` instead (different audience, different format, longer doc).
- **Multi-partner overviews** — this skill is per-partner.
- **Company-wide reviews** — use `performance(action: 'company')` directly.

The distinction that matters: a briefing is **forward-looking** (what to walk into a meeting knowing). A QBR is **backward-looking** (what happened last quarter, shareable doc). If the user wants to *send something to the partner*, route to QBR. If they want *internal prep before talking to them*, this skill.

## Inputs needed from user

### 1. Which partner?

Same resolution as `generate-qbr`:

1. `list_accounts` if the user has an account with that partner.
2. Otherwise `partners(action: 'list', filter_name: '<name>')` and match
   on `"Partner name"` (case-insensitive substring).
3. If multiple matches, list with `status` and ask the user to pick.

### 2. (Optional) Lookback window

Default: **last 30 days from today**.

Accept variants: `"last week"` (7 days), `"last 2 weeks"`, `"last month"`,
`"since last meeting"` (treat as 30 days unless user specifies a date),
`"since <YYYY-MM-DD>"`. Render dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format when calling
the MCP.

### 3. (Optional) Meeting context

A short tag like `"renewal call"`, `"QBR call"`, `"first intro"`,
`"escalation"`. If supplied, it reshapes the "What they'll likely want to
talk about" section. If not supplied, do not ask — generic framing is the
default.

## Orchestration sequence

Same 6 MCP tools as `generate-qbr`, just with a 30-day window by default
instead of a quarter. Skip steps only if the user's framing excludes them
(e.g. "skip pipeline, just the agreements").

| # | Tool call | Provides |
|---|-----------|----------|
| 1 | `list_accounts` | Customer-side name (rarely rendered in briefing — internal prep doesn't need a doc header) |
| 2 | `partners(action: 'list', filter_name: '<name>')` | Resolves `partner_id`. Skip if user provided one. |
| 3 | `performance(action: 'partner', partner_id, start_date, end_date)` | Headline movement in the window |
| 4 | `partner_artifacts(action: 'deals', partner_id, page: 1, limit: 20)` | All-time pipeline — used for "what they'll want to discuss" + "what you should bring up" |
| 5 | `commissions(action: 'partner', partner_id, start_date, end_date)` | Recent commission events |
| 6 | `referrals(action: 'for_partner', partner_id, page: 1, limit: 20)` | All-time referrals; filter to the window by parsing `"Submitted On"`. **Cap at ~2 pages** — this is a 30-second read; if the window isn't fully covered, report an approximate floor ("40+ in 30d"), don't paginate the whole history. |
| 7 | `partner_artifacts(action: 'agreements', partner_id)` | Open agreement blockers |
| 8 | `influenced_sourced_deals(partner_id, start_date, end_date)` | Sourced vs Influenced split for the window. Adds depth to "what they'll want to talk about" — partners commonly raise attribution disputes. |
| 9 | `performance(action: 'partner', partner_id, prev_window_dates)` | Previous window (e.g. 30 days before the current 30-day window) for delta indicators in the hero facts (`.fact-sub`). |

For exact field paths per tool, consult
[`references/mcp-field-paths.md`](references/mcp-field-paths.md).
The same backend serves this skill and `generate-qbr`; the same gotchas
apply (date format `YYYY-MM-DD` for `performance`, `last_stage_change_date`
is a duration not a timestamp, JSON serialization bugs on
`referrals(for_partner)`).

### Error handling

Inherits from `generate-qbr`: `partner_not_in_consent` → abort with reconnect
instructions; tool errors mid-run → render the rest and add a footnote.
A briefing is short, so if any single tool fails, a footnote is fine —
don't add a giant red banner.

## Status traffic light (briefing variant — 30-day window)

The same emoji vocabulary as QBR, but the conditions are tuned for a
shorter window:

| Indicator | Conditions |
|-----------|------------|
| ⚪ **Inactive** | `partner_status` = "Inactive" — meeting is likely reactivate-or-offboard |
| 🟢 **Hot** | Any of these in the window: ≥1 closed-won deal, ≥1 **real** referral approved (ignore test/placeholder/malformed entries — a date-as-name, `test`, or blank-company row is NOT a real approval), ≥1 agreement signed, or commission paid |
| 🟡 **Steady** | Default — activity in flight (open pipeline, pending referrals, in-progress agreements) but no closes in window |
| 🔴 **Cold / blocked** | `partner_status` = "Active" AND zero window activity AND foundational blocker present (unsigned agreement, stuck referrals, no open pipeline) |

The traffic light is the most important single signal — the partner
manager glances at it before reading anything else.

## Product how-to questions (`euler_help`)

If the user asks how EULER itself works or how to do something in the product — not about
their own data — e.g. "how do I register a deal", "where do I find X in the portal", "how
does onboarding work" — call `euler_help` with their question and answer briefly from its
result. Do not guess about product behavior. This is a tangent to this skill's main job:
answer in 1–3 sentences (no HTML report) and return to the task.

## Output format

Render a **single self-contained HTML file** — no external CSS, no
external fonts, no script tags. The user opens it in a browser, prints
to PDF, or shares the file / link (email, Notion, Slack). Note: pasting
raw HTML into Slack does not render — share the file or a link instead.
Portability across these targets demands a self-contained artifact.

**Target length:** ~200 words of body content. The point is 30-second
readability before walking into a call.

### How to produce the HTML

1. Read [`assets/styles.css`](assets/styles.css) and inline its full
   contents into a single `<style>` block in `<head>`. Do not link to
   the file — self-contained is the whole point.
2. Use the structural template in [`assets/template.html`](assets/template.html)
   as the skeleton. Fill in the data; never invent classes that aren't
   defined in the stylesheet.
3. The model output is the complete HTML — `<!DOCTYPE html>` through
   `</html>`. No surrounding markdown, no explanation, no headers.

### Euler design system (modern report treatment)

Output follows the **Euler design system** in the same modern layout as
`generate-qbr`, `portfolio-pulse`, and `pending-approvals-triage`: sticky **topbar**
with the Euler **text wordmark** → **hero** (eyebrow chip + headline with a gradient
`.accent` span + `.quick-facts` headline stats) → **spotlight** gradient panel (the
30-second read) → two short `.attention` sections → a compact `.table-wrap` of recent
touchpoints → footer. Even as a briefing it's one screen; keep it tight.

**Brand is a text wordmark, not an image.** Use `<span class="brand-mark">Euler</span>`
in topbar and `<span class="brand-mark footer-mark">Euler</span>` in footer — the remote
logo SVG renders broken in Claude. Keep the two `<link rel="preconnect">` tags.

**Lightweight (required).** No JavaScript, no images, no extra fonts beyond the two the
sheet `@import`s. Tone classes (`.hero-eyebrow`, `.spotlight` → `amber`/`red`/default)
follow the briefing traffic light.

### Required structure (component → meaning)

Follow [`assets/template.html`](assets/template.html). Sections, in order. Use ONLY
class names defined in the stylesheet.

1. **Topbar** — `brand-mark` "Euler" + `brand-label` "Partner Briefing · {Partner}".
2. **Hero** — `hero-eyebrow` (tone) "Prepared {YYYY-MM-DD} · {partner_status}";
   `<h1>` "Briefing: <span class="accent">{Partner}</span>"; subtitle = one-line state
   with the most important number + a `.data-pill` (complete/partial/stale).
3. **Quick facts** (`.quick-facts` → `.fact`): stats for the last {N} days. **Omit any
   fact whose value is zero** with no contextual sub-detail (a briefing has no room for
   "$0" cards). Numerals render mono via `.fact-value`.
4. **Spotlight** (`.spotlight` tone) — the 30-second read: `<h2>` one-line state; `<p>`
   one–two sentences (what they'll push on / what you should lead with). Wrap key figures
   in `<span class="num">`.
5. **01 · They'll raise** (`.attention` → `.att-row`, ≤3): what they'll likely want to
   talk about — each `att-name` a topic, `att-meta` the why, traceable to a real record
   (pending agreement, referral awaiting review, late-stage deal, recent commission).
   **Omit the section** if you cannot derive even one item.
6. **02 · You raise** (`.attention` → `.att-row`, ≤3): what you should bring up —
   actionable for the partner-manager, with a `status-pill` marker and a concrete impact
   phrase in `att-meta` when derivable ("blocks $50K Acme deal", "~$105K pipeline
   awaiting your decision"). Never requests for the partner; never "debug the tool".
7. **03 · Recent touchpoints** (`.table-wrap`): What · Detail · When (numeric date).
   Omit a row when its entity has no parseable date; **omit the whole section** if both
   rows would be omitted.
8. **Footer** — `brand-mark footer-mark` "Euler" + "Partner Briefing · {Partner} · last
   {N} days" + `.mono` "euler · partner-briefing".

Model output is the complete HTML (`<!DOCTYPE html>` → `</html>`) — no surrounding
markdown, no preamble.

**Language — the EULER product is multilingual.** Render all briefing copy in the language the
user used for the request (e.g. a Portuguese request → a Portuguese briefing, `<html lang="pt-BR">`).
Proper nouns, currency, metric values, and dates stay as-is. Applies to the rendered report only —
these SKILL instructions + CSS class names stay English.

### Status-pill labels (briefing variant — 30-day window)

| Emoji | Pill label | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 🟢 | `Hot` | Movement positive in the window (close-won, referral approved, agreement signed, commission paid) |
| 🟡 | `Steady` | In-flight activity (open pipeline, pending referrals, in-progress agreements) but no closes in window |
| 🔴 | `Cold` | Active partner + zero window activity + foundational blocker |
| ⚪ | `Inactive` | `partner_status = "Inactive"` — reactivate-or-offboard framing |

### Section omission rules

Briefings are short; empty sections kill the format. Omit:

- **"Quick stats" facts** (`.fact`) that are zero — omit the whole fact (don't render "Closed-won: $0")
- **"Recent touchpoints" rows** when the underlying entity has no parseable date
- **The entire "Recent touchpoints" section** if both rows would be omitted
- **The "What you should bring up" section** if you cannot derive at least one item from data (rare — usually there's an unsigned agreement or pending referral)

### What is NOT in the output

Same exclusions as QBR:

- Internal IDs (`partner_id`, `deal_id`, agreement id, referral id)
- Source-field annotations
- Disclaimers about MCP / Bubble / tool limitations
- Footer metadata like "Generated by skill v..."
- "No X data" placeholder lines (silence the row/section)

## Anti-hallucination rules

These rules are not optional. Many are inherited from `generate-qbr` —
the same MCP, the same data quirks, the same audience-protection
concerns. Briefing-specific additions are flagged with [BRIEFING].

0. **NEVER render internal EULER IDs in the output** (inherited from
   QBR Rule 0). Briefings are internal-only documents, but the partner
   manager copies them into Slack — and Slack messages drift outward.

1. **Silence empty sections** rather than printing "No X data"
   placeholders. The absence is itself a signal; a placeholder line
   dilutes the 30-second readability that is the point of a briefing.

2. **NEVER expose system internals** (inherited from QBR Rule 3). No
   `performance.X` references, no "the deals tool returned", no field
   paths visible.

3. **"What they'll likely want to talk about" must derive from actual
   data, not generic templates** [BRIEFING]. Avoid items like
   "they probably want to discuss the partnership" — that's empty
   filler. Each item must trace back to a specific record: an
   agreement in `Pending`, a referral pending review, a deal in a
   late stage, a recent commission. If you cannot derive at least one
   item from the data, the section may be omitted entirely.

4. **"What you should bring up" must be actionable for the
   partner-manager** [BRIEFING] — not requests for the partner to do
   things, and not action items about debugging the tool. Examples:
   - Good: "MNDA has been pending signature for X days — ask if there's
     a legal blocker"
   - Good: "Sierra referral hit a CRM write error — needs your manual
     entry"
   - Bad: "investigate why the performance tool returns 0"
   - Bad: "the partner should send more referrals" (that's the
     partner's job, not yours)

5. **Aging signals — bounded by data quality** (inherited from QBR
   Rule 15, refined v0.8.0). `last_stage_change_date` is a duration
   string. Values **≥ 9999 Days** (e.g. `"20599 Days"`) are the
   sentinel/null garbage — never use. Values **< 9999 Days**
   (e.g. `"19 Days"`, `"389 Days"`, `"942 Days"`) ARE real aging
   signals and can be cited: *"Everest closed-won 19 days ago"*,
   *"Best Buy in Demo Scheduled for 493 days — push or disqualify"*.
   For referrals, `"Submitted On"` is a real date and aging is
   straightforwardly derivable.

6. **Currency normalization** (inherited from QBR Rule 5). Treat `""`,
   `"$"`, `"$0"`, `"$0.00"` all as zero. Display zero as omitted (per
   Rule 1) or as `$0` only when the row is contextually material.

7. **Tier-conditional framing** (inherited from QBR Rule 13). The
   "What they'll likely want to talk about" inference adapts to
   `partner_status`:
   - **Prospecting / Onboarding** → topics skew toward activation
     (first referral, first deal, foundational agreements)
   - **Active** → topics skew toward production (pipeline, recent
     closes, commission expectations)
   - **Inactive** → topics are framed as reactivate-or-offboard,
     not operational

8. **Meeting-context shaping** [BRIEFING]. If the user supplied a
   meeting context tag, weight the "What they'll likely want to talk
   about" section toward that context:
   - `"renewal call"` → agreement expirations (note: we don't have
     expiration dates today; surface signed agreements at risk by age)
   - `"QBR call"` → quarter-level numbers, point user to running
     `generate-qbr` instead
   - `"first intro"` → minimal data assumed; briefing focuses on
     partner status + any agreements on file
   - `"escalation"` → blockers, rejected items, stuck states

9. **Cap each section at 3 bullets.** A briefing that runs to 10
   bullets is no longer a briefing. If you have more than 3 candidate
   items, keep the top 3 by impact (foundational blockers > stuck
   process > hygiene).

## Example user flow

```
User: "I have a call with Lumon Industries in 30 minutes — prep me"

Claude:
1. Reads this skill (partner-briefing playbook)
2. partners(action: 'list', filter_name: 'Lumon Industries') →
   partner_id = 1700000000000x000000000000000000
3. performance(action: 'partner', partner_id, '2026-04-25', '2026-05-25')
4. partner_artifacts(action: 'deals', partner_id) → 19 deals lifetime
5. commissions(action: 'partner', ...) → empty for the window
6. referrals(action: 'for_partner', partner_id) → 18 lifetime, 7 in
   the last 30 days (heavy referral activity from April)
7. partner_artifacts(action: 'agreements', partner_id) → 3 Complete + 2 Pending
8. Renders briefing markdown per the template.

User: opens the HTML in a browser (or saves as PDF) to skim before the call.
```

## Vs-previous-window delta (default-on as of v0.8.0)

Hero facts show a small `↑ +12%` / `↓ −5%` / `→ no change` indicator in the
`.fact-sub` when the current-window value differs materially from the previous
equivalent window. Same delta-rendering rule as QBR.

When the current window has zero activity and the previous also had
zero, omit the delta — the absence is the signal, no need for a
"→ no change" pill.

## Impact context on "What you should bring up" (default-on as of v0.8.0)

Each bullet in "What you should bring up" should embed a concrete impact
phrase when one is derivable from data:

- *"Sign MNDA — currently blocks $50K Acme deal from advancing"*
- *"Triage 7 pending referrals — ~$105K potential pipeline awaiting your decision"*

The phrasing differs slightly from QBR's Impact column because briefing
bullets are conversational, not table cells. Apply the same
"derived from real data, never invented" discipline.

## Data confidence indicator (default-on as of v0.8.0)

Same as QBR — add a `<span class="data-pill ...">` in the hero subtitle
summarizing fetch completeness (complete / partial / stale). Briefings are
short, so a partial-data badge is even more important — the reader needs to
know if commissions or referrals data was unavailable before walking into the
meeting.

## Known limitations (v0.8.0)

- **No `since last meeting`** without a date — we don't have meeting
  history. Treat as 30 days unless user supplies a date.
- **No call notes / transcript ingestion.** Introw's briefing supports
  this; ours doesn't. Future enhancement once a call-notes tool lands
  in the MCP.
- **No calendar / next-meeting lookup.** A briefing must be triggered
  by the user; we don't proactively detect upcoming meetings.
- **Pre-meeting briefing is per-partner only.** Batch ("brief me on all
  my calls today") would need calendar integration.

## Why this skill exists

A partner manager runs 5–10 partner calls per week. Pre-call prep
today means opening the EULER dashboard + the CRM + Slack history +
the agreement folder, one partner at a time. This skill compresses
that to one prompt + a 30-second read. At 8 calls/week × 5 min saved
per call × 50 weeks/year = 33 hours saved per partner manager per
year.
