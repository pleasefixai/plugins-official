# ThoughtSpot Developer Docs

This skill provides guidance for searching the ThoughtSpot developer documentation using `get-developer-docs-reference`.

If its tools are missing, ask the user to add ThoughtSpot's SpotterCode server as a custom server in Settings: `https://spottercode.thoughtspot.app/mcp/docs` serves `get-developer-docs-reference` and `get-rest-api-reference` with no sign-in, and `https://spottercode.thoughtspot.app/mcp` serves all three tools after a ThoughtSpot sign-in.

## When to Use

Apply this skill for general ThoughtSpot platform questions — anything not specifically about embed SDK code or a REST API endpoint:

- Platform features — Liveboards, Answers, Spotter, SpotIQ, Worksheets, TML, connections
- Security, authentication, SSO, SAML, OIDC, access control
- Deployment, administration, environment setup
- Theming, branding, and UI customization guidance
- Known limitations and compatibility information
- Any ThoughtSpot question that doesn't clearly fit the other two tools

## Query Tips

- Use this tool as a first choice for broad platform questions
- Use it as a fallback when `get-visual-embed-sdk-reference` or `get-rest-api-reference` return insufficient results
- Results include source URLs — always surface the link so users can read the full documentation page
