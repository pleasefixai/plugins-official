# Price Proposal

**Auth:** not required

Gets latest price for a specific contract.


| Surface | Gateway | Auth |
|---------|---------|------|
| Public market data | `wss://api.derivws.com/trading/v1/options/ws/public` | None — connect directly |
| Authenticated trading | OTP-issued `wss://api.derivws.com/trading/v1/options/ws/real` or `/ws/demo` | OTP URL from `POST /trading/v1/options/accounts/{accountId}/otp` |

Public market data needs no auth. Authenticated trading uses an OTP URL (issued from a REST call with your Bearer token — OAuth 2.0 or PAT; PAT auth also sends `Deriv-App-ID`), then connect to that URL and send messages directly. The symbol field is `underlying_symbol`. See [authentication](https://developers.deriv.com/llms/authentication.md).

- Response schema: [`proposal_response.schema.json`](https://developers.deriv.com/schemas/proposal_response.schema.json)

## Example

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket("wss://api.derivws.com/trading/v1/options/ws/public");
ws.onopen = () => {
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  "proposal": 1,
  "amount": 100,
  "barrier": "+0.1",
  "basis": "payout",
  "contract_type": "HIGHER",
  "currency": "USD",
  "duration": 60,
  "duration_unit": "s",
  "underlying_symbol": "R_100"
}));
};
ws.onmessage = (event) => console.log(JSON.parse(event.data));
```

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.derivws.com/trading/v1/options/accounts/{accountId}/otp" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <oauth_token>"
# Add -H "Deriv-App-ID: <app_id>" when authenticating with a Personal Access Token (PAT).
# => { "data": { "url": "wss://api.derivws.com/trading/v1/options/ws/real?otp=..." } }
```

Wait for explicit user confirmation before sending buy. Do not auto-purchase.

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket(otpUrl);
let pendingProposal;
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (msg.msg_type === "proposal" && msg.proposal?.id) {
    pendingProposal = msg.proposal;
  }
};
```

```javascript
onUserConfirmed(() => {
  if (!pendingProposal) return;
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({ buy: pendingProposal.id, price: pendingProposal.ask_price }));
});
```

A proposal id expires. If the stored proposal is stale, request a fresh proposal and put the new id through the same user-confirmation gate before buying from it; never reuse an expired id, and never treat a refresh as pre-confirmed.

## Request

|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `proposal` | integer: [1] | Yes | Must be `1` |

| `barrier` | string, pattern ^(?=.{1,20}$)[+-]?[0-9]+\.?[0-9]*$ | No | [Optional] Barrier for the contract (or last digit prediction for digit contracts). Contracts less than 24 hours in duration would need a relative barrier (barriers which need +/-), where entry spot would be adjusted accordingly with that amount to define a barrier, except for Synthetic Indices as they support both relative and absolute barriers. Not needed for lookbacks. |
| `barrier2` | string, pattern ^(?=.{1,20}$)[+-]?[0-9]+\.?[0-9]*$ | No | [Optional] Low barrier for the contract (for contracts with two barriers). Contracts less than 24 hours in duration would need a relative barrier (barriers which need +/-), where entry spot would be adjusted accordingly with that amount to define a barrier, except for Synthetic Indices as they support both relative and absolute barriers. Not needed for lookbacks. |
| `basis` | string: ["payout","stake"] | No | [Optional] Indicates type of the `amount`. |

| `duration` | integer, min 0, max 99999999 | No | [Optional] Duration quantity. Either date_expiry or duration is required. |
| `duration_unit` | string: ["d","m","s","h","t"] | No | [Optional] Duration unit - `s`: seconds, `m`: minutes, `h`: hours, `d`: days, `t`: ticks. |
| `growth_rate` | number | No | [Optional] Growth rate of an accumulator contract. |
| `limit_order` | object | No | Add an order to close the contract once the order condition is met (only for `MULTUP` and `MULTDOWN` and 'ACCU' contracts). Supported orders: `take_profit`, `stop_loss`. |
| `multiplier` | number, min 0 | No | [Optional] The multiplier for non-binary options. E.g. lookbacks. |
| `payout_per_point` | number | No | [Optional] Clients can provide payout_per_point directly, and the barrier will be calculated based on this payout_per_point value. |
| `selected_tick` | integer | No | [Optional] The tick that is predicted to have the highest/lowest value - for `TICKHIGH` and `TICKLOW` contracts. |
| `subscribe` | integer: [1] | No | [Optional] 1 - to initiate a realtime stream of prices. Note that tick trades (without a user-defined barrier), digit trades and less than 24 hours at-the-money contracts for the following underlying symbols are not streamed: `R_10`, `R_25`, `R_50`, `R_75`, `R_100`, `RDBULL`, `RDBEAR` (this is because their price is constant). |
| `underlying_symbol` | string, pattern ^\w{2,30}$ | Yes | The symbol code (obtained from `active_symbols` call). |
| `passthrough` | object | No | [Optional] Used to pass data through the websocket, which may be retrieved via the `echo_req` output field. |
| `req_id` | integer | No | [Optional] Used to map request to response. |
