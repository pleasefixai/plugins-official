# Creating a New Salesforce Project

Walk the user through a wizard that scaffolds a new Salesforce DX project, moves the work into the new project, connects it to an org, and configures it for development. Run each step in order, confirming with the user before any environment-changing action.

## Step 1: Choose a Project Template

This skill scaffolds **every** template the CLI offers, including React/Angular UI-bundle apps — creating a project is a core capability and shouldn't require installing a separate plugin just to pick a template. (Once the project exists, the `experience-ui-bundle-*` skills own *building it out* — pages, components, styling, deploy — but the initial scaffold happens right here, whether or not that plugin is installed.)

Read the template set **live from the CLI** — never hardcode it, because Salesforce adds templates over time and a baked-in list goes stale:

```bash
sf template generate project --help
```

Parse the `-t, --template=<option>` line's `<options: a|b|c|…>` list — those pipe-separated names are the authoritative template set. As of writing the CLI offers eight, all scaffolded here: `standard`, `empty`, `analytics`, `agent`, plus the UI-bundle set `reactinternalapp`, `reactexternalapp`, `angularinternalapp`, `angularexternalapp` (React/Angular × internal/external audience). Treat the live parse as the source of truth; the list here is only a fallback if the parse fails.

**Intent shortcut first.** Take the shortcut **only when the request fully resolves to exactly one template.** Anything with a missing choice goes to the picker so it can ask — never guess. Resolve `{template}` directly when:

- The request **names a non-UI template**: "empty/minimal project" → `empty`; "analytics project" → `analytics`; "agent project" → `agent`; "standard project" → `standard`.
- The request is a **UI-bundle app with BOTH framework AND audience clear** → the matching UI template (e.g. "internal React app" → `reactinternalapp`, "customer-facing Angular portal" → `angularexternalapp`). Internal = employee-facing/already-authenticated; external = customer/partner-facing with a login flow.

**A description of the app is NOT a template name.** "Build me a personal todo app", "an inventory tracker", "a CRM for my team" describe *what* to build, not *which* template — they do NOT resolve to a template, so they do **not** qualify for the shortcut. Do not infer `standard` (or any template) from the app's purpose, however obvious it seems: `standard` being the picker's default does not license skipping the picker. When the user hasn't named a template or a framework, **you must show the picker and let them choose** — silently assuming a template is the exact miss this step exists to prevent.

Everything else falls through to the picker, including:
- a bare "new project" / "create a Salesforce project" with no template named (the picker defaults to **Standard**),
- a **described app** with no template or framework named ("a todo app", "an inventory tracker") — surface the picker; never assume the app's purpose maps to a template, and
- a **partially-specified UI app** — e.g. "create a React app" with no audience. Never assume an audience. When the framework is already known but the audience isn't, skip the top-level picker and go straight to the framework/audience follow-up below to collect only the missing piece.

**Otherwise ask the user one question — "What kind of project?"** (single choice, four options). The picker surfaces the four most-requested kinds; **`empty` is deliberately picker-omitted** and reached only via the intent shortcut above ("empty/minimal project"). That is intentional — `empty` is the rarely-picked bare-project template, and spending one of four slots on it would crowd out a common choice. A user who wants it names it and the shortcut resolves it directly.

- **Standard** → `standard` (the default) — general-purpose `force-app` metadata project (Apex, LWC, objects, flows).
- **Agentforce agent** → `agent` — ships a sample Local Info Agent.
- **CRM Analytics** → `analytics` (Tableau CRM) — adds the `waveTemplates` directory.
- **React / Angular UI app** → a UI-bundle starter. This needs a framework + audience, so ask the user **one follow-up question** ("Which UI framework and audience?", four options) that maps directly to `{template}`:
  - **React — internal** → `reactinternalapp` · **React — external** → `reactexternalapp`
  - **Angular — internal** → `angularinternalapp` · **Angular — external** → `angularexternalapp`
  - Internal = employee-facing/already-authenticated; external = customer/partner-facing with login, registration, and profile.

The resolved template is `{template}`, which feeds Step 3. If the live CLI adds a new template, add it here (or, if it's another rarely-picked one, wire it as an intent-shortcut keyword rather than a fifth picker slot).

## Step 2: Choose a Project Name

Prompt the user for a project name. It becomes the new directory name **and is interpolated into the shell commands below**, so it MUST be strictly validated before any command uses it — never pass a raw name through.

**Allowlist, then reject-and-re-prompt.** Accept only names matching `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]*$` — letters, digits, `_`, and `-`, starting with a letter or digit. Anything else (spaces, path separators like `/`, a leading `.` or `..`, or shell metacharacters such as `; | & $ > < ( ) \` " '`) is invalid: explain why and ask again. A name like `proj;rm -rf ~` must never reach a command. As defense in depth, the commands below also quote `"{name}"` — but validation is the real guard, not the quoting.

## Step 3: Generate the Project

**Verify before generating** — do not run the command until you can check both:

- ☐ The `{name}` about to be interpolated is the **exact value that passed the Step 2 allowlist** (`^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]*$`) — not a raw, re-edited, or user-echoed string. If it never passed validation, go back to Step 2.
- ☐ `{template}` is one of the CLI's advertised options from Step 1.
- ☐ No `{name}/` directory already exists in the current working directory — the generate would fail (or risk clobbering an existing project) if it does. Check with `[ -e "{name}" ]` first; if it exists, don't overwrite: tell the user and go back to Step 2 for a different name.

Run in the current working directory:

```bash
sf template generate project -t {template} -n "{name}"
```

This creates a new `{name}/` directory under the current working directory. (`sf project generate` is the deprecated alias for this command — prefer `template generate project`.) No flatten step is needed — unlike a generate-into-an-existing-dir flow, this creates a fresh `{name}/` whose `sfdx-project.json` is already at the root the remaining steps run from.

**UI-bundle templates carry npm dependencies — but do NOT install them for the user.** A React/Angular starter isn't runnable (preview/build/lint fail) until its npm deps are present, and there are **multiple** `package.json` files — the project root and each UI bundle — each needing its own install. First-run install is the heavy step (multi-minute) and obvious through the latency, so it's a decision the developer should make explicitly — not something this skill runs unasked. Do **not** run `npm install` yourself. Instead, when `{template}` is a UI-bundle one (`react*`/`angular*`), tell the user in the closing message that deps aren't installed yet and hand them the commands to run when they're ready (see the UI-bundle pointer in the Closing Message).

## Step 4: Move Into the New Project

The remaining steps run from the project root, `{name}/`, where `sfdx-project.json` lives. Run each remaining `sf` command from inside it, for example:

```bash
cd "{name}" && sf org login web --alias {alias}
```

Tell the user in one short line that you are now working in `{name}/` (e.g. "Working in {name} now."), and that they can open `{name}/` as the workspace for later sessions. Then continue to Step 5.

## Step 5: Authenticate to an Org

Authenticate the org this project will deploy to:

```bash
sf org login web --alias {alias}
```

- Prompt the user for an `--alias` so later steps can reference the org by name.
- For a **sandbox**, add `--instance-url https://test.salesforce.com`.
- For **production**, omit `--instance-url` (defaults to login.salesforce.com).

If the user already has the org authenticated, skip the login and just collect the existing alias.

## Step 6: Set as Default Org

Set the freshly authenticated org as the project's default target:

```bash
sf config set target-org {alias}
```

## Step 7: Ensure Source Tracking Is Enabled

Check whether source tracking works against the org using a deploy preview (the lightest read-only source-tracking probe):

```bash
sf project deploy preview --target-org {alias} --json
```

If this fails with an error mentioning source tracking not supported or not enabled, offer to enable it:

```bash
sf org enable tracking --target-org {alias}
```

Confirm with the user before running the enable command.

## Closing Message

Once all steps are complete, tell the user:

```text
Your project is ready! Here's what was set up:

  ✅ Project generated: {name}/
  ✅ Working in {name}/
  ✅ Default org: {alias}
  ✅ Source tracking: enabled (or status)

Open {name}/ as your workspace to keep building in the new project.
```

For a **UI-bundle** project, the scaffold is done but its npm dependencies are **not installed** — that's the developer's call, not something this skill runs (first-run install is a heavy, multi-minute step). Tell the user their app needs its deps before it can preview/build/lint, and hand them the commands to run from inside the project when they're ready:

```bash
npm install                                        # project root
for b in force-app/main/default/uiBundles/*/; do   # each UI bundle
  [ -f "$b/package.json" ] && ( cd "$b" && npm install )
done
```

Then add a line pointing at the follow-on development skills. **Make the pointer framework-specific**, because the front-end build skill is React-only:

- **React** (`react*` templates) → `experience-ui-bundle-frontend-generate` builds pages/components (it's React/TypeScript-specific — shadcn/ui, react-router, `appLayout.tsx`/`routes.tsx`), and `experience-ui-bundle-deploy` ships the app.
- **Angular** (`angular*` templates) → there is **no** Angular front-end skill, so do **NOT** point at `experience-ui-bundle-frontend-generate`: its precondition requires a React `appLayout.tsx`/`routes.tsx`/`src/components/ui/` and will reject an Angular bundle. Build it out from the Angular starter's own `README`/toolchain; `experience-ui-bundle-deploy` still ships it (deploy is framework-agnostic).

Either way, those skills live in the `experience-react`/`experience-lwc` plugins; if the user doesn't have them, that's for *building* the app, not scaffolding it — the project they now have is complete and deployable as-is.

## Rules

- Run the steps in order; confirm before any environment-changing action (login, set-default, enable tracking).
- After Step 3, run every remaining `sf` command from inside `{name}/` (`cd "{name}" && sf ...`).
- For sandbox login, `--instance-url https://test.salesforce.com` is REQUIRED (the CLI default points at production).
- NEVER store or display access tokens.
- The project name is user input that flows into shell commands. Validate it against `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]*$` and reject-and-re-prompt on anything else BEFORE using it, and quote `"{name}"` in every command (including the `cd "{name}"` prefix). A name like `proj;rm -rf ~` must never be interpolated raw — validation is the guard, quoting is the backstop.
- For org auth on an existing project, run `sf org login web --alias {alias}` (add `--instance-url https://test.salesforce.com` for a sandbox).
- This skill owns **greenfield project creation** for every template, React/Angular included — a from-scratch "create a new project" ask, set up end-to-end (scaffold, move in, connect an org, enable tracking). Do NOT hand that initial scaffold off to another plugin. Scaffold here — but never run `npm install` for the user; installing a UI bundle's deps is the developer's explicit call (hand them the commands in the closing message). Then point the user at the `experience-ui-bundle-*` skills to *build and deploy* the UI app. The one boundary: when the UI-bundle scaffold is just one **composed step** of building out a UI-bundle app (driven by `experience-ui-bundle-app-coordinate`, no full project setup wanted), that's `experience-ui-bundle-project-generate`'s job, not ours — the two skills' descriptions carry the reciprocal DO NOT TRIGGER. Building/editing an existing UI-bundle app is always theirs; greenfield project creation is ours.
